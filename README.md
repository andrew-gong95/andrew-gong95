2. My Github account currently hosts a single repository containing my portfolio website.

3. The repository I created contains my portfolio website meant to introduce myself to the world.

4. To clone my repository I downloaded Github Desktop and navigated to my repository and selected the clone tool. From there I was able to copy my files from my portfolio website to the repository folder. AFter pasting the files in the repository folder, I opened Github Desktop to add a summary to the changes made and then selected the "commit to main" button. After adding the files to Github Desktop, I then used the "push origin" button to copy the files in my local repository folder to the online repository on Github.
